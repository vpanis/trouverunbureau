  h3 3) Workspaces
  br
  h5 What is a Hot Desk?
  br
  p
    | A “Hot Desk” is a Workspace that is not designated to one specific person. It is usually available “on a first come first served basis”. Once a person leaves the space another worker is free to work there.

  h5 What’s a Fixed Desk?
  br
  p
    | This is a desk that is designated for a specific person and cannot be occupied by anyone else.

  h5 What is a Private Office?
  br
  p
    | A “Private Office” usually refers to an office that is closed and provides a degree of privacy. It can be occupied by one or more people. As these spaces offer privacy they are more expensive than the other spaces in an office.

  h5 What’s a Home Office?
  br
  p
    | A “Home Office” is an office located in someone’s home. Some Guests prefer to work from a more intimate and more serene environment and so choose this type of space when they are booking a workspace. Sometimes they prefer this type of space when they are traveling and just need a place to relax or take a shower for a couple of hours.

  h5 What’s a Communal Space?
  br
  p
    | “Communal Spaces” are often open spaces that can accommodate multiple people in a more laid back vibe couches or a big table. Some Guests like to work in a more chilled setting and prefer Communal Spaces when booking. Since they are “first come first served” and less private they are also generally more economical.

  br
  h5 What’s the difference between a Meeting Room and a Conference Room?

  br
  p
    | A “Meeting Room” is generally used for meetings with a small size of co-workers getting together around a table. A “Conference Room” is generally used for seminars, conferences, large scale get-togethers… Usually, these rooms are much bigger than “Meeting Rooms” and have more amenities and optionality in terms of set up.

If your booking is for more than one month, payments will be released to the Host every 30 days.

This way, your Host knows that he will be paid on time and you know that your money is secure. Everyone is happy.

  h5 How does DeskSpotting handle deposits?
